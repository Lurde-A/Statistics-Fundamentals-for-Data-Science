GIVEN:
# Load libraries
import codecademylib3
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# Read in the data
students = pd.read_csv('test_data.csv')
# Write equation for a line
y = 9.85 * students.hours_studied + 43
# Create the plot here: 
#plt.plot(students.hours_studied, y)
plt.show()
  1. A dataset has been loaded for you in script.py containing fictional data from a group of students who were surveyed about their studying and breakfast choices prior to a math test.
The data is loaded as a variable named students. Create a scatter plot with hours_studied on the x-axis and score on the y-axis. Note that the code to show the plot (plt.show()) is 
already provided for you, so you do not need to add it!
//
  2. If you had to draw a line on top of this plot to describe the relationship between hours studied and math score, what would that line look like? Uncomment the code for the line 
plot (plt.plot(students.hours_studied, y)). Does this line look correct?
