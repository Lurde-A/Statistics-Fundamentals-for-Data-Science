                                      RANDOMN VARIABLES
  1. Run the given code as-is to simulate rolling a die five times.
//
import numpy as np
# create 6 sided "die"
die_6 = range(1, 7)
# set number of rolls
num_rolls = 5
# roll the "die" the set amount of times
results_1 = np.random.choice(die_6, size = num_rolls, replace = True)
print(results_1)                                                RESULT:
                                                               [1 4 5 2 6]
  2. Change the value of num_rolls so that results_1 has the results of rolling a die ten times.
//
import numpy as np
# create 6 sided "die"
die_6 = range(1, 7)
# set number of rolls
num_rolls = 10
# roll the "die" the set amount of times
results_1 = np.random.choice(die_6, size = num_rolls, replace = True)
print(results_1)                                                RESULT:
                                                               [1 4 5 2 1 3 4 5 5 5]
  3. Using the range() function, create a 12-sided die called die_12. Use similar logic as die_6.
//
die_12 = range(1, 13)
  4. Simulate rolling die_12 ten times, and save the rolls as results_2. Use the np.random.choice() function to simulate the rolls, and be sure to print out your results!
//
results_2 = np.random.choice(die_12, size = num_rolls, replace = True)
print(results_2)                                                RESULT:
                                                              [ 9  6  1 12  1  5  2 10  8  4]

                                      DISCRETE AND CONTINUOUS RANDOM VARIABLES
  5. Suppose you have a random variable that represents the time it takes a randomly selected person to run a mile. Is this variable discrete or continuous? In script.py, set the value 
of mile_time to 'discrete' or 'continuous' to answer.
//
mile_time = 'continuous'
candy = 'fill your answer here'
  6. Suppose you have a random variable that represents the individual pieces of candy a randomly selected child receives on a candy-giving holiday. Is this variable discrete or continuous? 
In script.py, set the value of candy to 'discrete' or 'continuous' to answer.
//
mile_time = 'continuous'
candy = 'discrete'

  7. Change the scaffolded code to calculate the probability of observing 3 heads in 10 fair coin flips. Save this probability to prob_1. Update x and n in script.py accordingly.
