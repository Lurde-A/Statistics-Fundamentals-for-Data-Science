  1. To the right, you should see a virtual coin and die. Click the button to “Flip Coin and Roll Die” simultaneously. Repeat this a few times to get an intuition for the probability that 
both the coin comes up tails and the die comes up as a five. Do you have an estimate of this probability? After this lesson, you will know how to calculate it!

Yep, the probability is 1/12, no need for extra lesson (I know... I am a math genius :))

                                      UNION, INTERSECTION, AND COMPLEMENT
  2. To the right is an applet that shows two overlapping circles: A and B. The two dropdown menus allow you to choose from different events. Event A can be any of the following:
- The outcome of a die roll is even
- The outcome of a die roll is a five
- The outcome of a die roll is less than or equal to three
Event B can be any of the following:
- The outcome of a die roll is odd
- The outcome of a die roll is anything but five
- The outcome of a die roll is greater than or equal to two
Using the applet, find the INTERSECTION and UNION between the following two events:
    - The outcome of a die roll is less than or equal to three
//
INTERSECTION:
1st Die roll Less than or Equal to 3
2nd Die roll is not Five
    - The outcome of a die roll is anything but five
//
UNION:
1st Die roll is Less than or Equal to Three
2nd Die roll is not Five
Using the applet, find the COMPLEMENT of the following events:
    -The outcome of a die roll is greater than or equal to two
//
COMPLEMENT:
1st Die is Five
2nd Die roll is Odd
    -The outcome of a die roll is five
//
COMPLEMENT:
1st Die is Even
2nd Die roll is not Five
