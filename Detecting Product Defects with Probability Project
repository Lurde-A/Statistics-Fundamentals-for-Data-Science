                                      DISTRIBUTION IN THEORY
  1. Create a variable called lam that represents the rate parameter of our distribution.
//
lam = 7
  2. You know that the rate parameter of a Poisson distribution is equal to the expected value. So in our factory, the rate parameter would equal the expected number of defects on a given 
day. You are curious about how often we might observe the exact expected number of defects. Calculate and print the probability of observing exactly lam defects on a given day.
//
expected_7 = stats.poisson.pmf(7, 7)
print(expected_7)                                           RESULT: 0.14900277967433773
  3. Our boss said that having 4 or fewer defects on a given day is an exceptionally good day. You are curious about how often that might happen. Calculate and print the probability of 
having one of these days.
//
print(stats.poisson.cdf(4, 7))                              RESULT: 0.17299160788207146
  4. On the other hand, our boss said that having more than 9 defects on any given day is considered a bad day. Calculate and print the probability of having one of these bad days.
//
print(1 - stats.poisson.cdf(9, 7))                          RESULT: 0.16950406276132668
                                      DISTRIBUTION IN PRACTICE
  5. You’ve familiarized yourself a little bit about how the Poisson distribution works in theory by calculating different probabilities. But let’s look at what this might look like in 
practice. Create a variable called year_defects that has 365 random values from the Poisson distribution.
//
year_defects = stats.poisson.rvs(lam, size=365)
  6. Let’s take a look at our new dataset. Print the first 20 values in this data set.
//
  7. If we expect 7 defects on a given day, what is the total number of defects we would expect over 365 days? Calculate and print this value to the output terminal.
//
print(sum(year_defects))                                    RESULT: 2527
OR
print(lam*365)                                              RESULT: 2555
  8. Calculate and print the total sum of the data set year_defects. How does this compare to the total number of defects we expected over 365 days?
//
Done it above
  9. Calculate and print the average number of defects per day from our simulated dataset. How does this compare to the expected average number of defects each day that we know from 
the given rate parameter of the Poisson distribution?
//
print(year_defects.mean())
print(np.mean(year_defects))                                RESULT: 6.832876712328767
  10.
