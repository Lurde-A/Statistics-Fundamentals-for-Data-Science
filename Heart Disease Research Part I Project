                                      CHOLESTEROL ANALYSIS
GIVEN:
import codecademylib3
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
# load data
heart = pd.read_csv('heart_disease.csv')
yes_hd = heart[heart.heart_disease == 'presence']
no_hd = heart[heart.heart_disease == 'absence']
  1. The full dataset has been loaded for you as heart, then split into two subsets:
yes_hd, which contains data for patients with heart disease
no_hd, which contains data for patients without heart disease
For this project, we’ll investigate the following variables:
chol: serum cholestorol in mg/dl
fbs: An indicator for whether fasting blood sugar is greater than 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)
To start, we’ll investigate cholesterol levels for patients with heart disease. Use the dataset yes_hd to save cholesterol levels for patients with heart disease as a variable named chol_hd.

  2. In general, total cholesterol over 240 mg/dl is considered “high” (and therefore unhealthy). Calculate the mean cholesterol level for patients who were diagnosed with heart disease 
and print it out. Is it higher than 240 mg/dl?
//
print(np.mean(chol_hd))                                              RESULT: 251.4748201438849
  3. Do people with heart disease have high cholesterol levels (greater than or equal to 240 mg/dl) on average? Import the function from scipy.stats that you can use to test the following 
null and alternative hypotheses:
Null: People with heart disease have an average cholesterol level equal to 240 mg/dl
Alternative: People with heart disease have an average cholesterol level that is greater than 240 mg/dl
Note: Unfortunately, the scipy.stats function we’ve been using does not (at the time of writing) have an alternative parameter to change the alternative hypothesis for this test. 
Therefore, you’ll have to run a two-sided test. However, since you calculated earlier that the average cholesterol level for heart disease patients is greater than 240 mg/dl, you can 
calculate the p-value for the one-sided test indicated above simply by dividing the two-sided p-value in half.
