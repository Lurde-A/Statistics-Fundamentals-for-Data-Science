                                      CHOLESTEROL ANALYSIS
  1. The full dataset has been loaded for you as heart, then split into two subsets:
yes_hd, which contains data for patients with heart disease
no_hd, which contains data for patients without heart disease
For this project, we’ll investigate the following variables:
chol: serum cholestorol in mg/dl
fbs: An indicator for whether fasting blood sugar is greater than 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)
To start, we’ll investigate cholesterol levels for patients with heart disease. Use the dataset yes_hd to save cholesterol levels for patients with heart disease as a variable named chol_hd.
